Writing a shell script after a long time!

Shell script to check whether a process is running, and in case it is not, start the process. Also has the option to force start.

Plan to use it with a couple of crons, to take care of a process on a remote MAC machine that dies very often, or gets corrupted:

1) One cron checks every 10 minutes, and if the process isn't running starts it.
./check_process.sh "xyz_process" "/usr/bin/xyz_process"

2) Another cron running once a day forcess the process to restart (to recover in case it stops responding).
./check_process.sh "xyz_process" "/usr/bin/xyz_process" F
